## Overview

I have built the accessible accordion following [W3C guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/examples/accordion/).I have built the page using Vue. There wasn't any need to use Vue or any other front-end framework, but I have used it because it's the most comfortable tool for me.
